# BFS_Large_Database_Search
A simple implementation of BFS (Breadth-first search) for exponentially large database path search is developed and introduced here. This piece of code is part of an assignment solving **Bacon-Number**-related problems, including finding actors of certain Bacon number, or finding the shortest path, given start and end actor. The BFS_Large_Database_Search Method is mainly for the second problem.

- The method requires no external library and any kinds of *import*.
- The method doesn't use `L.pop(0)` and avoid using Lists, which are used widely by other examples but work very slow on a large database.
